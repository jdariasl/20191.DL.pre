    "## Autoencoders and PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "**Principal Component Analysis** is a specific kind of dimensionality reduction technique. Review [this example](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/decomposition/plot_pca_iris.html) to get acquainted with PCA as implemented by `scikit-learn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Autoencoders** are strongly related to PCA. See the notes [here](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/journey-from-principle-component-analysis-to-autoencoders-e60d066f191a) and [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/courses/CSC411/14_pca.pdf). In some way, an autoencoder can be viewed as a generalization of PCA when using other activation functions and deeper architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab **you will have to do two things**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain in your own terms (and math) why PCAs are so strongly related to a Linear Autoencoder. Include a reasoning of why _linear_ and not other kind of autoencoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build an example with actual data showing this equivalence. You may use the dataset of **eigenfaces** referred two in the noted linked above, or another dataset of your choice.\n",
