    "**IN YOUR EXPERIMENT THERE MUST BE AN EVIDENCE OF ACCURACY IMPROVEMENT IN TEST DATA AS YOU INCREASE THE COMPLEXITY OF YOUR CNN ARCHITECTURE**. For this, you will need to iterate several times until you select an appropriate Google images query pair so that the visual classification task beholds the appropriate complexity.\n"
